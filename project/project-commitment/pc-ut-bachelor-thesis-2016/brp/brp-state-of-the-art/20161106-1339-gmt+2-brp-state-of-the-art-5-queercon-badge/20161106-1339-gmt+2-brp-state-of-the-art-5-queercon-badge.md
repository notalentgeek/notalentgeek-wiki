* The features of this Queercon badge are these.
    * 60 cyan LEDs.
    * A button.
    * RF modules to have connection to other badge.
* There is this premade feature that when the user push he button it will "spread" the LED color into badges nearby. This is pretty cool.
* This shows me that RF connection can be used to broadcast data into nearby gadget.
