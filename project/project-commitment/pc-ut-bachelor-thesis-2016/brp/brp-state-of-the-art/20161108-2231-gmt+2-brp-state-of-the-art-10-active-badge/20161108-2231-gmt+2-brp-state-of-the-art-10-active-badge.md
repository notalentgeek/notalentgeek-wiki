* Here is my review of Active Badge that was built by Olivetti Research in late 80's (around 1990).
* The website of Olivetti Research, [http://www.olivetti.it/](http://www.olivetti.it/). However, this is different than the Olivetti Research. The Olivetti Research went and built Olivetti, I assume this was because later Olivetti Research became AT&T Laboratories.
