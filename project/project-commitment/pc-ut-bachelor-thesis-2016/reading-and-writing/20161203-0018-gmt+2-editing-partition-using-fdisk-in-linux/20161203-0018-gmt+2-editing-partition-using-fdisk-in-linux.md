* Formatting guide for .img operating system installation in Raspberry PI, [http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/blog/2013/06/noobs-for-raspberry-pi/](http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/blog/2013/06/noobs-for-raspberry-pi/).
* I am not sure if I ever need this tutorial. This tutorial uses `fdisk` CLI (command line interface) application to manage edit partition. While, most operating system that I have used has GParted pre - installed, I have never have a case in which I need to use `fdisk`.
