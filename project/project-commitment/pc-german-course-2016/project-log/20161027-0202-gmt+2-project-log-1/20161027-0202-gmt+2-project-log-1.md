* German is an official language in 7 countries.
* There will be at least one country that speak Germany in every continent on Earth.

* English and German share 60% of vocabulary.
* There are East Germanic language as well.
* I think East Germanic language is just like those traditional languages in Indonesia.
* There are Gothic and Vandalic language those share similarities with East Germanic language. Although both languages are now extinct.
* German has a lot of compound words.
* I think this is what makes German sounds funny at first. But in the end they just mesh some word together. There are no not compound word that has monstrous length.
* The first book was also __*printed*__ in German in 1454.
* The Gutenberg Bible.

* Some words.
* Some words those are slang and are altered from modern English words.
* "Geist" means ghost in German.
* "Kaputt" means broken in German. I am not sure what is the difference of having additional "t" in the word.
* "Schadenfreude", means that you are relieved of someone having a bad situation. This word has no literal translation to English or any other language. Only German (I think has this word).
* "Joggen" is a slang German word based from English's jogging.
* "Gedownloadet" is also a slang German word based from English's download.
* "Handy" means cellphone.
* "Fingerspitzengefuhl" means a feeling that is on the tip of fingernail. I am not sure what is this means. Perhaps something like "peribahasa" or like an implicit word to determine a feeling.
* "Schnapsidee" is a German exclusive word to express bad idea. "Schnap" means shot (as it is in drink, get drink, alcoholic beverages). So it is like an idea that you get while you are drunk.
* "Fernweh" is an antonym to home sick. A feeling that you want to be as far from home as possible.

* German alphabet pronunciation is more or less the same with Indonesian ones, except for several words. And it is also read as it is (well, mostly).

* "Y" is read upsilon. I do not know why.
* And German "Z" is read "tzet". It is like you have "z" and "c" together.
* For example "zwei" will read as it has "c", so it sounds like "zchwei".

* Das ist die basis.
    * "Das" is like to be of English (like "is" or "are", I think).
* "Wilkommen" means welcome.
* "Ich bin Mikael." means "I am Mikael.".
* "Und" means "and".
* "Ich heisse Mikael" state that my name is Mikael. Although I am not sure what heisse means.
* "Ich komme aus Indonesien." means "I come from Indonesia".
    * Notice how "Indonesia" becomes "Indonesien".

* "Wie hast du?" means "Who are you?".
* "Komme" reads as it has "e" in it. So it is not read as "kom" but "komme".
* "Das ist schon." means "That is good.".
* "Schon" means something is nice/good.
* "Die basis" means "the basic".
    * So "die" is like German's article word, perhaps.

* "Fur sport, ich mag Tennis spielen." means "For sport, I like to play tennis.".
    * I think the "spielen" suffix "en" is like English suffix "ing".
    * So it is for continuous tense.
* "Ich untersicht in de jungen schule." means "I studied in boys school.".
    * I am not sure if this sentence is 100% correct.
    * But German plural noun has suffix of "en".
    * This means if suffix "en" is used in verb it means continuous tense, while if it is used in noun it means plural.

    * I think this is like this.
