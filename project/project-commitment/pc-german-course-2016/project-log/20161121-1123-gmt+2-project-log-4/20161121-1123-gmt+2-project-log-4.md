* "Wie ist deine Addresse?" means "Where is your address?".
    * I am not sure on why "wie" (how) is used here, instead of using  of "wo" (where). I think this is specifically for German language.
    * The "ist" means that the address that we are talking about is an "it" so it uses "er"/"sie"/"es"'s "ist".
    * So the "Addresse" (the noun) will determine which "to be" to use.
* "Wie ist ihre Addresse?" is formal way to say "Where is your address?".
    * This is the same way to ask "Where is your address?" however the use of "ihre" here is because it is the possessive of "Sie".
    * And, "ihre" is not "ihr" because the "Addresse" is a feminine noun.
* "Wo die Person wohnt?" means "Where is this person live?".
    * "Wohnt" is come from "er"/"sie"/"es" "wohnt".
    * For example, "Wo wohnen sie?" means "Where do they live?".

* "Geboren" means "bear".
* "Geborte" means "born".
* This is quite weird because in English the verb 1 is "bear" while the verb 2 is "born".
* While in German "geboren" means born, while "geborte" means the past version of "geboren". While in English "geboren" itself is already verb 2.
