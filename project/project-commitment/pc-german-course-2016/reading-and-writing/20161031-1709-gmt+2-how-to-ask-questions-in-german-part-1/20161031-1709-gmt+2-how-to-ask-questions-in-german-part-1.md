* Alright! There are these things about "was".
* For some reason German is really like to use "wo".
    * Instead of "von was" they said "wovon".
    * Instead of "mit was" they said "womit".
    * There are other "wo" as well for "von", "mit", "nach", "um".

    * Wovon hast du letzte Nacht getraumt?
    * Worauf freust du dich?
    * Woran denkst du?

![./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-24.png](./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-24.png)

    * What did you dream of last night?
    * What are you looking forward to?
    * What are you thinking about?

![./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-25.png](./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-25.png)

* In German the preposition is in the beginning of the sentence. These below are some example of the English sentences with the German sentence structure.
    * Of what did you dream last night?
    * To what are you looking forward?
* Hence, it is translated like these in German.
    * Wovon hast du letzte Nacht getraumt?
    * Worauf freust du dich?
    * Woran denkst fu?

![./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-26.png](./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-26.png)

* "Whom" translates into "wem" or "wen".
* "Whose" translates into "wessen".
* If you want to know who did/does/is something then use "wer".
* When you are using "wer" always put the preposition in the front of it.
    * In English the structure is like this whom + from_or_of_or_to_or_with?
    * In German the structure is like this zu_oder_von_oder_fur_oder_mit + wem_oder_wen?

* There are three synonym of "warum", which are these.
    * "Weshalb".
    * "Weswegen".
    * "Wieso".
* There are difference at all from all those words. So I might as well stick with "warum".

![./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-32.png](./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-32.png)

* For examples.
    * "Ich bin genauso gross wie du." means "I am exactly as tall as you.".
    * "Die Suppe riecht ein bisschen wie Bier." means "The soup smells a little like beer.".

![./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-35.png](./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-35.png)

* This word has a lot of forms like these.
    * "Welche".
    * "Welchem".
    * "Welchen".
    * "Welcher".
    * "Welches".
* The form is depending on how the subject is singular or not.

* But for all "welche" is just fine and correct.

![./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-38.png](./20161031-1709-gmt+2-how-to-ask-questions-in-german-part-1-38.png)

* There is a possibility for "welche" to be used as it is "das", "der", or "die".
* But for safety it is recommended to only use "welche" for asking question.
