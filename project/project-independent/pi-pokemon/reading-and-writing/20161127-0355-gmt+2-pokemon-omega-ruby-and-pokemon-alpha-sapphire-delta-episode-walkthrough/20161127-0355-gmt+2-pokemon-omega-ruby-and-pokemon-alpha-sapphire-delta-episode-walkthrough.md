* Here is a walkthrough for Delta Episode of Pokemon Omega Ruby and Pokemon Alpha Sapphire, [http://www.serebii.net/omegarubyalphasapphire/deltaepisode.shtml](http://www.serebii.net/omegarubyalphasapphire/deltaepisode.shtml).
* Good to mention, that in order to get Deoxys synchro - ed you can kill the Deoxys in the first encounter and then encounter it again later after Elite Four.
* Here is the screenshot of the guide. The screenshot is a little bit hard to read though, I have tried other way to capture screenshot, however this is still the best screenshot I can take.
