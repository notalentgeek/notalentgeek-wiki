* I was wondering how can I access the GTS from Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon.
* From the previous Pokemon generation, usually I can access GTS easily from the lower screen.
* In Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon you can access online features by entering castle in the middle of festival plaza and access the computer on your right.
