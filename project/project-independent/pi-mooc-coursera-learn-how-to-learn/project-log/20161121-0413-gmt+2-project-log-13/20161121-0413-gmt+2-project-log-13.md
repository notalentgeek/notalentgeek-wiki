    * Doctor.
    * Pilot.
* Self consciousness is not good to be used when making complex decision rapidly.
* The ideas and theories that you already have in mind can be a blockade to new ideas/knowledges.
* So, there is a benefit of being stupid because easier to process new ideas. Whereas smarter people tends to stuck with the ideas that they have learn.
    * New thought can be easily go through your brain.
* Smaller working memory make easier for you to generalize what you have learning in new way.
