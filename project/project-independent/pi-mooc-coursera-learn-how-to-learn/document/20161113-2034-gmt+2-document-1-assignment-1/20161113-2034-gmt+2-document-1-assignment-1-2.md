* Introduction.
    * There are a lot of medias to share what you have learn.
        * Blog post to share personal thoughts. For example what does Learning How to Learn course teach you about.
        * Facebook to share personal achievements. For example if you manage to run 5 kilo meters.
        * Forums, IRC Channel, Reddit, ... for a you to share anything related to more specific audience. For example, I use forum and Reddit to get feedback on my programming codes.
        * Imgur to share pictures. I use Imgur because people can easily give comment/feedback on the Imgur itself or from Reddit. The pictures that I post here mostly technical screenshot (electrical wiring or programming).
        * ScribD.
        * Twitter to share brief thought or feeling to a specific matter(s). Do not forget to use hash tag for you to manage your own Twitter tweet.
        * Wiki is a platform for sharing personal knowledge base. You can use Wiki to share bookmarks and your own summarizations. For example a bookmark (URL) to this Learning How to Learn course with a brief description why this bookmark (URL) is matter to you. Another example would be your own step by step on how to overcome procrastination.
        * YouTube to share video. For example I use YouTube to help me to get confident on public speaking with foreign language.
* What is my problem?
    * My personally problems are these.
        * It is hard for me to do a thing until it is completely done (learning, project, ...).
        * It is hard for me to get motivation to do a thing. This results on me procrastinating until the dominoes fall back on me, then I get depressed.
* What is the solution?
    * The idea is simple. You show off what you are learning or what you want to learn. You share everything related to your goal whether it is the product itself or the progress.
    * These need __not__ to be emphasized on the "show off" itself, but more as a contribution or a way to inspire others.
    * Personally, when I showing off on my progress toward certain my goal/project, I will have tendency to finish the project. This is because I will feel guilty and shame if people knows that I fail the project.
* What is the problem of the solution?
    * Most people hates egocentric and narcissistic individual.
    * Sometimes your progress is not meant for every people in your circle.
    * The problems to this method are that not every people willing to see your progress.
* How you should not do this?
    * Do not be egocentric and narcissistic. Specially in social networking like Facebook or Twitter, share the progress as subtle as possible. By sharing subtlety you make sure that only specific people knows what you are going to achieve. For example if you are trying to hit gym everyday try not to add any word in your status or tweet. Instead just put a photo with indirect description.
    * However, you should be as informative as possible if the thing that you want to show off is more into technical matter like electronics or programming.
