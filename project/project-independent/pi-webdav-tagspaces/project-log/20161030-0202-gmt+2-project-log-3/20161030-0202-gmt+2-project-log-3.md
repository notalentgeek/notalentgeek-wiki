* I finally managed to run TagSpaces in my Ubuntu 16.04 server droplet that is hosted in DigitalOcean.
* The problem was I put the `tagspaces` folder in `/var/www/`. The solution is to put it in `/var/www/html/`.
* After that I need to set correct owner and permission to this `tagspaces` folder.

```markdown
cd /var/www/html/
sudo chmod -R 755 tagspaces
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data tagspaces
```

* Now, everything is set. What I need to do is to upload my TagSpaces note to the OwnCloud.
* Upload the all the TagSpaces notes into the root of OwnCloud. Let say my notes folder is `wiki-notalentgeek` and it is located in the root directory of OwnCloud.
* Then open the TagSpaces WebDAV and add new location to `/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/wiki-notalentgeek/`. Add a name for this location and everything is good.
* Well... not!
    * The WebDAV based TagSpaces is not capable of displaying .md (MarkDown) files.
    * The WebDAV based TagSpaces is also not capable of displaying relative image from .md (MarkDown) files. The `![./path/to/image.png](./path/to/image.png)` will not be displayed.
    * In my case I have "+" in my folders name. Having symbol in folder name make the folder cannot be opened and will return this error, `The desired path could not be opened.`.
* So in the end this is actually quite a bummer for me. But nevertheless, I learn a lot about setting up server and LAMP stack in Linux environment.
