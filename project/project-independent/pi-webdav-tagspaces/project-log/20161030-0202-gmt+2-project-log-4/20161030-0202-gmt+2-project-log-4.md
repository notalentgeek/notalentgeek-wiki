* So, in the end this is what I need to do for installing WebDAV TagSpaces. Starting from creating the Droplet until using the TagSpaces itself.
* Follow this tutorial in order (I have this offline as well).
* [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets/](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets/), initial SSH tutorial and then install Ubuntu 16.04. This will create "connection" between the DigitalOcean droplet and my personal computer. This is like creating specific for you to specific room.
* [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04), after setting up SSH connection and installing Ubuntu 16.04 the next part will be to setup server environment for Ubuntu 16.04.
* [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04), after initial server setup then the system needs to be installed with LAMP (Linux, Apache2, MySQL, PHP) stack.
* After installing LAMP stack into the system. I need to install these package so that the system works seamlessly with DigitalOcean environment. Although I did not install these packages and my TagSpaces installation works. Nevertheless, installing these packages would cause no harm, so I suggest to install these packages anyway.

```markdown
sudo apt-get install php-bz2 php-curl php-gd php-imagick php-intl php-mbstring php-xml php-zip
```

I am not sure what is this for, but for sure this is what makes [https://](https://) turns into [http://](http://).
    * Self - signed certificate is meant if I use IP address.
    * In case I am using custom domain I need to follow this tutorial, [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04).
* [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-owncloud-on-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-owncloud-on-ubuntu-16-04), finally install OwnCloud.
    * Do not forget to start the MySQL server. Otherwise admin account cannot be made because there is no connection to the database.
    * Connect to MySQL server using this command `sudo systemctl start mysql`.
* After installing OwnCloud, download TagSpaces WebDAV version here, [https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-web.zip](https://www.tagspaces.org/downloads/tagspaces-web.zip).
* Extract everything from the .zip file and then place the `tagspaces` folder in `/var/www/html/` in your remote server (DigitalOcean droplet).
* After that set owner and permission of the `tagspaces` folder.

```markdown
cd /var/www/html/
sudo chmod -R 755 tagspaces
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data tagspaces
```

* At this point TagSpaces should have working. Access it at [https://ip_address_here/tagspaces/](https://ip_address_here/tagspaces/).
* Put everything that you want to access from TagSpaces in OwnCloud. Use the web interface of OwnCloud to upload files and folders.
* Those files and folders then can be accessed from TagSpaces by this URL, `/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/`.
* This URL `/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/` will refer to the root directory of OwnCloud.
* Here are some limitations of WebDAV TagSpaces.
    * The WebDAV based TagSpaces is not capable of displaying .md (MarkDown) files.
    * The WebDAV based TagSpaces is also not capable of displaying relative image from .md (MarkDown) files. The `![./path/to/image.png](./path/to/image.png)` will not be displayed.
    * In my case I have "+" in my folders name. Having symbol in folder name make the folder cannot be opened and will return this error, `The desired path could not be opened.`.
