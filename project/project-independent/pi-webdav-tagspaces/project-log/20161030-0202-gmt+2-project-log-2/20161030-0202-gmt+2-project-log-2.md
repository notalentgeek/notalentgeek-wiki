* First go to Ubuntu 16.04 initial server guide, [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04).
* After done with initial server setting, I need to install LAMP environment, [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04).
* Install these packages as well, `sudo apt-get install php-bz2 php-curl php-gd php-imagick php-intl php-mbstring php-xml php-zip`.
* After installing and setting LAMP, I need to manage self signed SSL, [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-16-04).
* After this I tried to install OwnCloud, [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-owncloud-on-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-owncloud-on-ubuntu-16-04).
* I did not manage to know for sure what was the cause of an error that makes OwnCloud could not connect to MySQL database.
* The error code was like this, `SQLSTATE[HY000][1045] Access denied for user 'user_test'@'localhost' (using password: yes)`. Some people told me that I might put wrong credentials (password, database name, ...). However, I can successfully login using MySQL interactive shell. Hence, here are two main possibilities for the error.
    * MySQL server was turned off.
    * The special characters in the MySQL password preventing the OwnCloud to login.
* The error was happened because the MySQL server was disable. To enable it execute this command, `sudo systemctl start mysql`.
