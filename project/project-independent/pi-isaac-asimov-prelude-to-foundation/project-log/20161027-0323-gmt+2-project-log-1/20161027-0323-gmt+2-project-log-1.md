* Emperor Cleon the galactic emperor that resides in Trantor. Trantor is like Star Wars' Coruscant in this universe.
* Hari Seldon.
* There is also a reporter named Hummin.
* Psychohistory is a subject that try to predict the future using mathematical equations.

* Human mind works randomly and hard to predict using mathematical equations.

* In the ideal way we can only predict the aggregate situation not a situation of one sole variable (one lone electron).

* In Imperial Sector in Trantor, to go without a hat is a sign of "low breed" human being.

* Anti gravity elevator.
* It works without any surface to step on.

* There is a case of Hari Seldon taught that he was being chased by an air jet.
* The way that the book describes (or how I read) here is like Hari Seldon is being chased by anti gravity UFO.

* There is a Trantorian timeband that holds the Galactic Standard Time.
* But I am pretty sure that time will go faster or slower based on the gravitational pull.
* So far the story line is pretty decent. Roughly it is like this.
    * Hari Seldon invited by the emperor talking about his research on how to predict future.
    * Emperor Cleon has also a right hand who is cunning (I forget the name).
    * Then Hummin come to save Seldon to a university in Trantor.
    * There he met a female historian.I think he loves this woman.
    * In the university Seldon cannot be apprehended by the Trantorian government.
    * However, Seldon took a risk to go to outer area of the university of which government has access to capture him. He was with the meteorology students from the university.
    * He nearly died from freezing when he was chased by the UFO.
    * But he saved then try to look who might betray him into go to outer area of the university.
