* I was wondering on whether to use "are" or "is" after "either" or "neither"
* Based on this link, [http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/10304/which-is-correct-neither-is-or-neither-are](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/10304/which-is-correct-neither-is-or-neither-are), the answer is to use "is".
* For example, "Neither of these options is available.".
