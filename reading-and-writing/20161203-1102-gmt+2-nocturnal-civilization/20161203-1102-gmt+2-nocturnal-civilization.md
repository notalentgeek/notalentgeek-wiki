* There is this Reddit thread asking whether there was a civilization that is nocturnal. Means that the people active mostly in the night and then sleep during day, [https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5g7khi/has_there_ever_been_a_primarily_nocturnal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5g7khi/has_there_ever_been_a_primarily_nocturnal/).
* The answer is simply there is no human civilization ever that is active in the night.
* However, there was Kingdom Of Hormuz that was around Persian Gulf that has more activity in the night.
* They were less active than other civilization at the day because the temperature was quite high in day. Hence, they prefer to work when the temperature is lower in the night.
* Here is the screenshot from the Reddit thread.
