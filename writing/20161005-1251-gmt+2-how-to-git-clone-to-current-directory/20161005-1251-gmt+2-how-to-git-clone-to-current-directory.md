* When you do `git clone` by default it copy the root directory into the current directory in the terminal.
* I want so that `git clone` directly extract things in the current directory.
* Using `git clone` to clone in the current directory using this command, `git clone https://github.com/user_name_github/name_project.git .`.
* Notice the dot in the end of the command.
* Note that the directory need to be empty before cloning!
